Classification performance, which is very important in machine learning, states the success state of a classifier implementing a specific algorithm. Binary classifications or two-class classifications separate a given input into two opposite classes such as 'presence' vs. 'absence' of a disease (healthy) or a condition, 'spam' vs. 'non-spam' for an e-mail, and 'malign' vs. 'benign' software.

TasKar is a handy visually supported compact calculator to see the performance of a given binary classification by entering only the True Positives (***TP***), True Negatives (***TN***), False Positives (***FP***), and False Negatives (***FN***). It is based on an academical study given in the notes below.

Just input the four measures (***TP***, ***TN***, ***FP***, ***FN***) and TasKar calculates the entire performance measures and metrics.

TasKar calculates and shows 56 measures/metrics including True Positive Rate (*TPR*), Accuracy (*ACC*), Balanced Accuracy (*BACC*), *G*, *F1*, Normalized Mutual Information (*nMI*), Cohen's Kappa (*CK*), and Mathews Correlation Coefficient (*MCC*).

I hope that TasKar becomes a standard tool for calculating and expressing binary classification performances as well as using in machine learning education and trainings.

Please, contact and/or inform me for further usage on TasKar.
