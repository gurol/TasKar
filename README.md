TasKar – Binary Classification Performance Metrics Card

Classification performance, which is very important in machine learning, states the success state of a classifier implementing a specific algorithm. Binary classifications or two-class classifications separate a given input into two opposite classes such as 'presence' vs. 'absence' of a disease (healthy) or a condition, 'spam' vs. 'non-spam' for an e-mail, and 'malign' vs. 'benign' software.

TasKar, which is a lightweight version of TasKar Pro, is a handy visually supported compact calculator to see the performance of a given binary classification by entering only the True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN).

Just input the four measures (TP, TN, FP, FN).

There are currently 37 measures/metrics in TasKar lightweight version. TasKar Pro has over 190 measures/metrics with many properties for each measure and metric.

I hope that TasKar (even lightweight version provided here) becomes a standard tool for calculating and expressing binary classification performances.

Please, contact me for further usage on TasKar (Lightweight or Pro version).

NOTE: TasKar is prepared as a OpenDocument Spreadsheet file and tested with LibreOffice Calc (v5.1.5.2).
